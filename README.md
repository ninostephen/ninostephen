- 👋 Hi, I’m @ninostephen
- 👀 I’m interested in security engineering, distributed systems and many experimental things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing. Taking a break is important folks :D I was learning Golang and K8s before starting the break. 
- 😶‍🌫️ I'm open to experimenting things. Like literally. New project in alpha? No problem. Unstable application? Send it over!
- 👨🏻‍🔧 The real struggle is finding someone to give me a chance. Come on folks. If I was able to clear RHCE at age 16, I can probably pick your stack too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on security engineering and emerging technology projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email! I always check my email. Every other hour infact. I like my Inbox clean :D
- 🌐 Haven't you checked out my blog yet? You can find it here: [My Blog](https://ninostephen.gitbook.io/)
